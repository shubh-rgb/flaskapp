1. Clarity of the Instructions:
The instructions were generally clear, detailing each step required to complete the challenge. 
The challenge was well-structured, and it was easy to understand what was expected at each stage. 

2.Difficulty Level of the Challenge:
The challenge was moderately difficult, appropriate for someone with experience in DevOps and cloud engineering. 
It tested a range of skills, from application development to containerization and Kubernetes deployment. 
The inclusion of both Docker and Kubernetes added complexity, making it a comprehensive test of practical DevOps skills.

3. Technologies, Tools, and Approach Used:

Technologies: Docker, Kubernetes, Flask (for Python applications), and Minikube.
Tools: The challenge required familiarity with Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and bash scripting for automation.
Approach: The approach was sequential, requiring the completion of one task before moving on to the next, 
which was logical and ensured that all aspects of the challenge were covered.

4. Areas Found Particularly Challenging or Frustrating:

Service Communication in Kubernetes: Setting up communication between the two services in Kubernetes required careful attention to service names and ports. 
Misconfigurations in these areas led to connectivity issues, which were challenging to debug.
Docker and Kubernetes Integration: Ensuring that Docker images were correctly built, pushed, 
and then deployed in Kubernetes without authentication issues was tricky, especially with private repositories.
Port Forwarding: Testing services locally using port forwarding in Kubernetes was challenging and required some troubleshooting.

5. Meaning of this Coding Challenge:
The challenge was a practical test of essential DevOps skills. It evaluated the ability to:

Develop and containerize applications.
Deploy and manage containerized applications in a Kubernetes environment.
Automate the entire process using scripts.
It reflected real-world scenarios where multiple services need to interact within a Kubernetes cluster,
making it a valuable exercise for anyone in a DevOps role.

6. Suggestions for Improvement:
Clarify Kubernetes Environment: Explicitly stating that services should communicate via Kubernetes service names rather than localhost 
could prevent common mistakes.
Error Handling: Including a note on handling common errors or providing hints for debugging could make the challenge less frustrating.
Automated Testing: Including a simple automated test suite that candidates can use to validate their deployment would be beneficial.
